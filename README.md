# 💡 Heart Disease Clinical Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

### 📊 Project Overview
This Power BI project focuses on analyzing **heart disease clinical records** to uncover key factors influencing patient survival and heart performance.  
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of medical data through KPIs and visual insights that help identify **risk patterns** and **health trends** across different age groups.

---

### 🚀 Objectives
- Analyze clinical data to determine **survival rates** and **mortality trends**.  
- Understand how **age, kidney function, and heart ejection fraction** relate to survival outcomes.  
- Identify the impact of **lifestyle and health factors** such as smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, and anaemia.  
- Build an interactive, professional dashboard for **data-driven insights**.

---

### 📌 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Survival Rate**
- **Average Age of Survivors**
- **Total Survivors**
- **Total Deaths**

---

### 📈 Visual Insights
1. **Survival Count & Average Serum Creatinine by Age Group**  
   → Shows how kidney function correlates with survival outcomes.

2. **Survival Count & Average Ejection Fraction by Age Group**  
   → Visualizes heart performance variation among survivors.

3. **Survival Rate by Age Group (Line Chart)**  
   → Tracks survival changes and age-related risk patterns.

4. **Ribbon Chart**  
   → Highlights the effect of smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, and anaemia across different age groups.

5. **Slicers (Sex Filter)**  
   → Enable gender-specific analysis for deeper insights.

### 🧠 Project Workflow
- **Data Ingestion** – Loading and preparing heart failure dataset.  
- **Data Modeling** – Establishing relationships and cleaning data.  
- **KPI Creation (DAX)** – Creating measures such as `Survival Rate` and `Age Group`.  
- **Dashboard Design** – Using Power BI for visual storytelling.  
- **Layout Design** – A clean and aesthetic dashboard background created in **Canva**.

---

### ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – Data modeling, DAX calculations, visualization.  
- **Canva** – Custom dashboard layout design.  
- **Microsoft Excel / CSV** – Dataset preprocessing and validation.

---

### 📂 Dataset
The dataset used: *Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset*  
Contains patient health data such as **age, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, smoking, diabetes, blood pressure, anaemia,** and **DEATH_EVENT (0 = survived, 1 = died)**.
